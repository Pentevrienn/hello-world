# hello-world
Therse are my notes to self, or to others as well... who knows :)

I am Pentevrien, or more human-like - Aga :)
Since the VBA, which I use in my automations of processes at work, became somewhat narrow for me, I decided to learn Python.
I am so excited each day to write an app, or learn something new, so I decided to bleed some of my projects here. I will probably be ashamed of some of them in a couple
of months or years, but hey - aren't we all sometimes, before we learn some more? ;)


PS. There is another account called 'Pentevrien' here - without the doubled 'N' at the end - and it was my account - unfortunately I lost the email it was assiociated with (the domain does not exist anymore), so if you'll stumble upon that one - rest assured it's not identity theft or anything so sinister.
